# AR-Car-Game
AR Car game created using Unity's AR Foundation.

ARCore is Google's framework for building augmented reality experiences on smartphones. You can use Unity's AR Foundation to build cross-platform AR applications.

The goal of the game is to collect packages using a car that you control using your handheld device.
However, this won't happen in an entirely virtual world! You'll mix physical atoms and digital bits to create a new type of player experience by creating a game that understands the environment around the player.

1. Detect real-world planes and draw a playing field over it.
2. Cast rays from the camera's view and detect intersections with planes.
3. React to real-world lighting conditions to give your game extra realism.
